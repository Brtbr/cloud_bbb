## :heart_eyes: Features
This integration provides the following features:

* **Room setup** Create multiple room configurations with name, welcome message, ...
* **Share guest link** Share the room link with all your guests
* **Custom presentation** Start a room with a selected presentation from your file browser

## :rocket: Install it
The easiest way to install this app is by using the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/bbb).
If you like to build from source, please continue reading.

To install it change into your Nextcloud's apps directory:

    cd nextcloud/apps

Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/sualko/cloud_bbb.git bbb

Then install the dependencies using:

    make build


## :gear: Configure it
find out your BBB secrets by '''sudo bbb-conf --secret'''

enter these secrets in the BigBlueButton settings on the general configuration page of your NC

## Create your first room
Got to the BigBlueButton section inside your personal settings page and enter a
room name. That's it. You can now distribute the room url.

## Enter a room from files
Use the ... menu and select the desired BBB configuration to enter the room.
Beware that if the room is already running the presentation will **not** be
updated.

# Troubleshooting
- before installing, make sure your BBB is running correctly
- if no session opens with the ... menu of files, but a session opens in the
  general configuration page, look at your browser console. It will show a well
  hidden complaint that for sharing always a password is required. If this is
  the case, remove that requirement in sharing / enforce password.
- if the room doesn't appear in the ... menu of files, a browser/cache reload
  might help
